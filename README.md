# Hi guys! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Dawid Wijata. I'm an Angular / .NET Full Stack Developer from Warsaw, Poland.  Currently, I'm doing my B. Sc. in Computer Science at WULS in Warsaw. I'm also a huge fan of everything connected with Linux. You can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.2]][1]

### :office: Commercial experience
At work, I create new business solutions and maintain the existing software based mostly on Angular / .NET Core with microservices architecture. As a Junior Developer I learn about good coding practises, software architecture and project management.

### :mortar_board: Academic projects
I've also ran several repositories containing projects that I make for various subjects at university. Recently I've made a tool with Python and Kivy which helps me while planning the month schedule at work.

### :house: After getting all things above done
After hours, I like developing applications which solve my everyday problems or just let me have fun :satisfied:.

### :wrench: Technology stack

In my programming career I used many technologies and software engineering concepts but I mainly use these ones to write software:

#### Backend

- .NET Core
- LINQ (both query and functional syntax)
- ASP.NET Core
- NSwag
- Entity Framework Core
- WPF

#### Frontend

- Angular 12
- Vue (2 & 3), Vuex, Vue Router, Nuxt
- single-spa
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- HTML, (S)CSS
