### :office: Commercial experience
My work experience is mostly based on developing and maintaining software on **Angular / .NET** environment. 

### :mortar_board: Academic projects
I've also ran several repositories containing projects that I make for various subjects at university. Recently I've made a tool with Python and Kivy which helps me while planning the month schedule at work.

After hours, I like developing applications which solve my everyday problems or just let me have fun :satisfied:.
